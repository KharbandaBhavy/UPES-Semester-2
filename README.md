# UPES-Semester-2
- This repository belongs to the second semester of my college.
- This semester contained a lot of important subjects like Data Structures, Operating Systems, Basics of Python Programming.
- This repo contains the codes for all the assignments, I got for these subjects.
- Happy Coding üßëüèª‚Äçüíª.....

### Approximate idea of Experiments for python programming folder. Although, the doc of detailed problem statements is also added in the folder.
- Experiment-1: Conditional Actions in python.
- Experiment-2: Use of Dictionary and Lists in python.
- Experiment-3: Use of string and substring in python.
- Experiment-4: Use of functions and recursive functions in python.
- Experiment-5: File handling in Python (reading/writing files).
- Experiment-6: Exception Handling and File handling in python.
- Experiment-7: Classes in python.
- Experiment-8: Use of Tkinter in python.
- Experiment-9: Use of Numpy in python.
- Experiment-10: Use of Pandas in python.

## Operating System lab üíª
### Approximate idea of Experiments for Operating System folder. Although, the doc of detailed problem statements is also added in the folder.
#### Use Linux environment for these programs. (like Kali, Ubuntu)
- Lab Exercise-1: Basic Linux Commands
- Lab Exercise-2: First Come First Serve, Shortest Job First, and Round Robin CPU schedulling.
- Lab Exercise-3: Round Robin and Priority schedulling with arrival time CPU schedulling.
- Lab Exercise-4: To implement Banker's Algorithm and use of Semaphores(Producer Consumer Problem).
- Lab Exercise-5: To implement memory management techniques using paging and segmentation technique.
