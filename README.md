# UPES-Semester-2
- This repository belongs to the second semester of my college.
- This semester contained a lot of important subjects like Data Structures, Operating Systems, Basics of Python Programming.
- This repo contains the codes for all the assignments, I got for these subjects.
- Happy Coding üßëüèª‚Äçüíª.....


## Python Programming üêç
### Approximate idea of Experiments for python programming folder. Although, the doc of detailed problem statements is also added in the folder.
- Experiment-1: Conditional Actions in python.
- Experiment-2: Use of Dictionary and Lists in python.
- Experiment-3: Use of string and substring in python.
- Experiment-4: Use of functions and recursive functions in python.
- Experiment-5: File handling in Python (reading/writing files).
- Experiment-6: Exception Handling and File handling in python.
- Experiment-7: Classes in python.
- Experiment-8: Use of Tkinter in python.
- Experiment-9: Use of Numpy in python.
- Experiment-10: Use of Pandas in python.

## Operating System Lab üíª
### Approximate idea of Experiments for Operating System folder. Although, the doc of detailed problem statements is also added in the folder.
#### Use Linux environment for these programs. (like Kali, Ubuntu)
- Lab Exercise-1: Basic Linux Commands
- Lab Exercise-2: First Come First Serve, Shortest Job First, and Round Robin CPU schedulling.
- Lab Exercise-3: Round Robin and Priority schedulling with arrival time CPU schedulling.
- Lab Exercise-4: To implement Banker's Algorithm and use of Semaphores(Producer Consumer Problem).
- Lab Exercise-5: To implement memory management techniques using paging and segmentation technique.



## Data Structures Lab üòµ
### Approximate idea of Experiments for Data Structures folder. Although, the doc of detailed problem statements is also added in the folder.

- Experiment-1: Find sum of all array elements using recursion.
- Experiment-2: Convert uppercase string to lowercase using for loop.
- Experiment-3: Find the Transpose of a matrix.
- Experiment-4: Find out the largest and smallest number in a given array.
- Experiment-5: Implement single Linked List data structure and its operations like insert and delete in the beginning/end.
- Experiment-6: Implement Circular Linked List and its operations.
- Experiment-7: Implement Doubly Linked List and its operations.
- Experiment-8: Using array and functions implement Stack and its operations like insert, delete, and display.
- Experiment-9: Using array and functions implement Queue data structure and its operations like insert, delete, and display.
- Experiment-10: Using array and functions implement Circular Queue data structure and its operations like insert, delete, and display.
- Experiment-11: Read the numbers from the user into an array and sort them using the insertion Sort algorithm.
- Experiment-12: Write a program to implement linear and binary search algorithms.
- Experiment-13: Implement a hash function on student SAP-ID and categorize them in to their 10 families based on the last three digits. Example: Student with SAP-ID 5000423 belongs to family 9 and student with SAP-ID 5000425 belongs to family 2 based on last three digits.
- Experiment-14: Create a binary tree using an array/linked List. And perform Inorder, Preorder and Postorder Traversal.
- Experiment-15: Implement Heap Sort
